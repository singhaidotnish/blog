<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m {{ site.name }}, a creative and energetic individual with a passion for animals, adventure, and hands-on crafting. Living with ADHD has shaped the way I approach life—always curious, always exploring, and never afraid to try something new.

I’ve had the thrill of riding cross-country, embracing the excitement of the open trail, and I love working with my hands, crafting unique objects from PVC as a fun side hobby. Whether I’m out in nature or working on my next creative project, I find joy in pushing limits and bringing ideas to life.

Let’s connect—whether it’s about creativity, animals, or just sharing a love for new experiences!</p>
